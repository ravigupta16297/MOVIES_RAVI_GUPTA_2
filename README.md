Movies Mania basically uses React js,css and bootstrap.
For the state management purpose i have used redux.
I have also used pagination for navigating out to different pages.
As the user types any text in the search box it automatically calls the search api and the result is shown ,also the pagination changes dynamically.
It also includes a spinner.
